Release 2.0

- How to build a package -
The basic element is a "conf.php" file located at the root dir of the module.
All fields are compulsory
<<
$module_conf['dummy']["name"] = "dummy";				Name in the module directory
$module_conf['dummy']["rname"] = "Dummy Module";		Name in Centreon
$module_conf['dummy']["release"] = "2.0";				Current release
$module_conf['dummy']["infos"] = "First of all";		Infos
$module_conf['dummy']["is_removeable"] = "1";			Removeable or not
$module_conf['dummy']["author"] = "Oreon Team";			Author
$module_conf['dummy']["lang_files"] = "1";			Is there lang files to load ?
$module_conf['dummy']["sql_files"] = "1";			Is there sql files to load ?
$module_conf['dummy']["php_files"] = "1";			Is there php files to load ?
$module_conf['dummy']["svc_tools"] = "1";  			Is there tools to add to service pages (Centreon >= 2.2) ?
$module_conf['dummy']["host_tools"] = "1";			Is there tools to add to host page (Centreon >= 2.2) ?
>>

The structure of the package have to be like this :
conf.php
php/ (if set in conf.php)
sql/ (if set in conf.php)
lang/ (if set in conf.php)

- If you have lang files, you have to set at least an en.php
- You can add other stuff at the first level, or add subdirectories... You manage your own topology at this point.
- If ["is_removeable"] = "1" and ["sql_files"] = "1", sql dir must have two files : 'install.sql' and 'uninstall.sql'
- If ["is_removeable"] = "0" and ["sql_files"] = "1", sql dir doesn't need file 'uninstall.sql'
- If ["is_removeable"] = "1" and ["sql_files"] = "0", sql dir doesn't need file
- If ["is_removeable"] = "1" and ["php_files"] = "1", php dir must have two files : 'install.php' and 'uninstall.php'
- If ["is_removeable"] = "0" and ["php_files"] = "1", php dir doesn't need file 'uninstall.php'
- If ["is_removeable"] = "1" and ["php_files"] = "0", php dir doesn't need file

To create a menu to the dummy page create here, execute a SQL command, three requests for each menu level
<<
INSERT INTO `topology` (`topology_id`, `topology_name`, `topology_icone`, `topology_parent`, `topology_page`, `topology_order`, `topology_group`, `topology_url`, `topology_url_opt`, `topology_popup`, `topology_modules`, `topology_show`) VALUES ('', 'mod_dummy_menu1', NULL, NULL, 100, 100, 1, './modules/dummy/dummy.php', NULL, '0', '1', '1');

- How to upgrade a package -

Create a branch called 'dummy-release' like 'dummy-1.0' and write a conf.php similar to the module one :
$upgrade_conf['dummy']["rname"] = "Dummy Module Reloaded";
$upgrade_conf['dummy']["release_from"] = "2.0";
$upgrade_conf['dummy']["release_to"] = "2.1";
$upgrade_conf['dummy']["infos"] = "Reloaded the experience of doing a dummy package";
$upgrade_conf['dummy']["is_removeable"] = "1";
$upgrade_conf['dummy']["author"] = "Centreon Team";
$upgrade_conf['dummy']["sql_files"] = "0";
$upgrade_conf['dummy']["php_files"] = "1";
$module_conf['dummy']["svc_tools"] = "1"; 
$module_conf['dummy']["host_tools"] = "1";

Then, like for the module, you can create two files 'upgrade.php' and 'upgrade.sql' in each directory. Those files will be launch if you put the flag to '1' in the configuration file.
At this point, you can moove files, executes requests...
